 # Design doc review by Joe Cubed
___
 - Component map is good.
 - No description at the top and the project is unclear.
 - Example row + table name is helpful to see in Database Organization.
 - SQL table usage and description is unclear and could be explained.
 - Name and type of page could be explained on the Front End Map, and the buttons and inputs could be better labeled.
 - Work distribution seems a little unbalanced.
 - Project timeline could be more detailed.
