- What do you mean when you say the RESTful APIs "lives on Python files" in your program components and roles?
- Are you planning on using Foundation or Bootstrap? (and clarify)
- We think that all the arrows in your component map should be double ended (like they are between the SQLite Database and the Flask App/Python).
- Why are there only two database tables for the APIs, what are you doing with the third API?
- Specify which APIs you are using and which one corresponds to which table. Also specify what each API does and how you plan on using/incorporating it.
- Why are you storing API data in a database instead of making API calls when you need information?
- In your front-end map, it would be helpful to add a description of what your site is and does.
- We like the projected timeline! 
- In general, your design doc feels a little vague. Adding more information about what your webapp does and how you're incorporating your chosen APIs will help viewers better understand your project.
